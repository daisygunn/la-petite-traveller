        <h2>Welcome to La Petite Traveller</h2>
         <h3>The go-to guide for any backpacker!</h3>
            <p>I have been very fortunate to spend a lot of time exploring our beautiful planet. 
            Whilst there are plenty of travel blogs and guides out there, I found that when researching for 
            my first big trip, there just wasn't enough out there about backpacking on a budget that didn't 
            involve missing out on half of the country! I want to give you, my readers, the best tips that 
            I've learnt along the way so that you can make the most of every second & every penny that 
            you have to make life-long memories. <br>
            <br>
            You will also find a review of my most recent trip to Sri Lanka <a href="#">here!</a></p>

        <div class="travel_tips_container" id="travel_tips" >
                <strong>Getting started</strong>

                You need to have a good idea of where you want to go even if that's just a starting point before contemplating planning (sounds obvious but you'd be surprised how many people just say they want to go away!!). 
                For my first big backpacking trip, I desperately knew I wanted to start in India and so that was destination 1 - it was only once I was in India that I then started to think about where to go next and made decisions based on flight prices, weather in the surrounding countries and what the food was meant to be like! I'm a vegetarian and so food is always a big factor for me. This is not the ideal way for many to travel as it does come with some risks but I found not being tied down to flights and routes meant I was able to travel based upon the people I was meeting & recommendations I was being given. 

                <strong>Route planning</strong>
                Read, read & read again, you are not the first person visiting this country and so there will be plenty of recommendations available for you. If you're stretched for time then be realistic, moving every day is bound to knacker you out and won't always allow for the most fun to be had! Of course, we are all different people but I find spending 2-3 days in any one place my preferred pace of travel. 
                Be flexible, have an idea of where you want to go but be open to it changing. Some of my favourite places have been off my planned route - so please do not think you have to stick to any plans!!! 

                <strong>Packing</strong>
                Pack light - It is KEY to not overpack, get yourself a decent rucksack (look into how litres it is) and be sensible. You will be so thankful once you're away that your bag doesn't weigh 25kg and that you're able to access all of your items with ease. Do you need 6 pairs of shoes? Probably not.
                It is also very important to consider the countries that you're visiting and ensuring that you take appropriate clothing so as not to offend.  
                Rolling your clothes is the only way to do it, get yourself some packing cubes and organise your stuff into sections, this will make accessing your clothes super quick and easy!
                You can find my essentials packing list on the right > 

                <strong>Budgeting </strong>

                Be strict! Have a good understanding of how much you have to spend per day/per week/per month and only allow yourself access to this budget. Research how much travelling from place to place is going to cost, consider all options. Travelling overnight is often the cheapest way to get around as you also save on a night of accommodation! 
                Depending on which country you visit the hostels may have kitchens, this is a great way to save on money as you can prepare lunch or dinner. 
                Book somewhere that has breakfast included - makes all the difference getting 1 meal a day for free!
                Don't be scared of street food, this is often how the locals eat, the food is cheaper and it's normally DELICIOUS. 

                <strong>Toiletries</strong>

                Shampoo and conditioner bars are a great way to save space, weight and money. I bought this shampoo and this conditioner and both lasted me my entire 6 months of travelling!!
                Always have Imodium & rehydration sachets (or something similar) just in case you get an upset stomach. Having these on hand got me out of a couple of tricky situations. 

                <strong>Useful apps/websites</strong> 
                Look into the available travel apps for the country you're visiting: some of my faves are:
                Busbud is great for buses in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.
                HostelBookers
                Use Rome2Rio if you're stuck on how to get from A to B.
