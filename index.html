        <h2>La Petite Traveller</h2>
         <h3>The go-to guide for any backpacker!</h3>
            <p>I have been very fortunate to spend a lot of time exploring our beautiful planet. 
            Whilst there are plenty of travel blogs and guides out there, I found that when researching for 
            my first big trip, there just wasn't enough out there about backpacking on a budget that didn't 
            involve missing out on half of the country! I want to give you, my readers, the best tips that 
            I've learnt along the way so that you can make the most of every second & every penny that 
            you have to make life-long memories. <br>
            <br>
            You will also find a review of my most recent trip to Sri Lanka <a href="#my_last_trip">here!</a></p>

                        <h4>Getting started</h4>

                        You need to have a good idea of where you want to go even if that's just a starting point before contemplating planning (sounds obvious but you'd be surprised how many people just say they want to go away!!). 
                        For my first big backpacking trip, I desperately knew I wanted to start in India and so that was destination 1 - it was only once I was in India that I then started to think about where to go next and made 
                        decisions based on flight prices, weather in the surrounding countries and what the food was meant to be like! I'm a vegetarian and so food is always a big factor for me. This is not the ideal way for many to 
                        travel as it does come with some risks but I found not being tied down to flights and routes meant I was able to travel based upon the people I was meeting & recommendations I was being given. 
                        <br>
                        <h4>Route planning</h4>
                        Read, read & read again, you are not the first person visiting this country and so there will be plenty of recommendations available for you. If you're stretched for time then be realistic, moving every day is 
                        bound to knacker you out and won't always allow for the most fun to be had! Of course, we are all different people but I find spending 2-3 days in any one place my preferred pace of travel. 
                        Be flexible, have an idea of where you want to go but be open to it changing. Some of my favourite places have been off my planned route - so please do not think you have to stick to any plans!!! 
                        <br>
                        <h4>Packing</h4>
                        Pack light - It is KEY to not overpack, get yourself a decent 
                        <a href="https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/p/osprey-womens-fairview-70-travel-pack-E2414409.html?channable=00ff736964003230363337305f393876&colour=98&utm_source=google&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping&utm_campaign=Luggage%20Mid%20Priority%20tROAS-BOFU-PLA%20&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_pos=&cq_med=pla&cq_plt=gp&gclid=Cj0KCQjwna2FBhDPARIsACAEc_WcPdMLZhtyg7c35qRCHCMHbA8QVvOnVXGV5kg9ROMx53l6Dzf0YZUaAkFvEALw_wcB')" 
                        target="_blank" aria-label="Link to example of a good rucksack, opens in a new tab.">bag</a> (look into how litres it is) and be sensible. You will be so thankful once you're away that your bag doesn't weigh 25kg 
                        and that you're able to access all of your items with ease. Do you need 6 pairs of shoes? Probably not.
                        It is also very important to consider the countries that you're visiting and ensuring that you take appropriate clothing so as not to offend.  
                        Rolling your clothes is the only way to do it, get yourself some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eono-Essentials-Lightweight-Organizers-Accessories/dp/B07JWCW87Y/ref=asc_df_B07JWCW87Y/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310446945021&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12797766163628329236&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006609&hvtargid=pla-596526684374&psc=1" 
                        target="_blank" aria-label="Link to packing cubes on Amazon, opens in a new tab">packing cubes</a> and organise your stuff into sections, this will make accessing your clothes super quick and easy!
                        You can find my downloable essentials packing list <a href="#">here</a>.
                        <br>
                        <h4>Budgeting </h4>
                        Be strict! Have a good understanding of how much you have to spend per day/per week/per month and only allow yourself access to this budget. Research how much travelling from place to place is going to cost, 
                        consider all options. Travelling overnight is often the cheapest way to get around as you also save on a night of accommodation! 
                        Depending on which country you visit the hostels may have kitchens, this is a great way to save on money as you can prepare lunch or dinner. 
                        Book somewhere that has breakfast included - makes all the difference getting 1 meal a day for free!
                        Don't be scared of street food, this is often how the locals eat, the food is cheaper and it's normally DELICIOUS. 
                        <br>
                        <h4>Toiletries</h4>
                        Shampoo and conditioner bars are a great way to save on space, weight and money. I bought this <a href="https://uk.lush.com/products/honey-shampoo/honey-i-washed-my-hair" 
                        target="_blank" aria-label="Link to Lush shampoo bar, opens in a new page">shampoo</a> and this <a href="https://uk.lush.com/hair-care/conditioner/valkyrie" target="_blank" 
                        aria-label="Link to Lush conditioner bar, opens in a new page">conditioner</a> and both lasted me my entire 6 months of travelling!!
                        Always have Imodium & rehydration sachets (or something similar) just in case you get an upset stomach. Having these on hand got me out of a couple of tricky situations. 
                        I also always take a first aid kit with me, loaded with plasters and painkillers - being prepared for anything will make your life so much easier!
                        <br>
                        <h4>Useful apps/websites</h4>
                        Look into the available travel apps for the country you're visiting, some of my faves are:.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Busbud is great for buses in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.</li>
                                <li>HostelBookers <em>(use my code LAPETITET123 for an introductory 15% discount)</em></li>
                                <li>Rome2Rio is great for almost any country you're in, perfect place to start if you're stuck on how to get from A to B.</li>
                            </ul>

            <h4>My Route</h4>
            <p>I've made it pretty obvious by now that I fell deeply in love with Sri Lanka, the combination of hikes, nature, food, culture and of course the beaches was 
                something I hadn't expected - it is a real delight and somewhere I would recommend everyone to visit. In fact, I don't think I've shut up about it since I
                 got home. There is something for everyone and being a pretty small country - the UK is about 3.7 times bigger than Sri Lanka - it is quick and easy to get 
                 around so perfect for shorter trips too!

                Below is a map of my route, I had just over 3 weeks in total and as I was travelling over Christmas I had to factor in that everything would be busy and 
                fully booked, after some research I decided not to risk being stranded on Christmas Day and I pre-booked a few places and so had to stick to my schedule. 
                I was also adamant to spend at least 10 days lying on a beach so wanted to move pretty quickly through the beginning of my itinerary. </p>

                <li>Negombo - 1 night<br>
                The main airport in Sri Lanka is called 'Bandaranaike International Colombo Airport' but is actually located closer to Negombo.
                My flight got in pretty late so I decided to spend my first night and day in Negombo, it was nice to see the beach but there's not much to see here - 
                can easily be missed.</li>
                
                <li>Colombo - 1 night <br>
                Colombo is Sri Lanka's capital and it is a typically big, busy Asian city but has an interesting architectural twist. Due to the colonial rule in the 16th Century, 
                there are a plethora of beautiful colonial buildings mixed in with swanky new office blocks - making this city a real delight to explore. There is an abundance of 
                street food available in the markets and the Pettah Bazaar is definitely worth a visit. 
                The Barefoot bar is an iconic Colombo institution and offers live Jazz on Sundays - this is not a cheap place and so not ideal for those of us on a tight budget!
                If I'm being totally honest, we probably should have spent more time properly exploring Colombo but with just under a month (and a desperate want to sit on the beach) 
                I wanted to get moving ASAP and so only spent a night. 
                </li>

                <li>Sigirya - 2 nights <br>
                As luck would have it there was a train strike when we were in Sri Lanka which meant I had to revert to travelling by bus - we got a bus to Dambulla and then a tuktuk to our guest house. We stayed here and I cannot recommend it enough - our host was delightful and made some of the nicest food I've ever eaten in my life.
                Sigirya is famous for 'Lions Rock' which is an impressive sight from below and offers stunning views from the top. It takes just over an hour to climb and is mostly up stairs. Get there early, avoid the crowds and also the height of the sun! 
                I was also advised by a friend to climb the smaller rock opposite Pidarangula, this is less of a tourist attraction and is more of a wild climb  - there are no stairs and it involves some basic climbing. The top offers incredible views of Lions Rock and the climb was a little more fun.
                </li>

                <li>Dambulla - 1 afternoon <br>
                We stopped in Dambulla on the way to the bus station as we wanted to visit the Dambulla Cave Temple; it is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding plains. Major attractions are spread over five caves, which contain statues and paintings. It comes with a small cost of 1500 LUK and is well worth it!
                </li>

                <li>Kandy - 2 nights <br>
                STUFF ABOUT KANDY
                Pinnawella elephant sanctuary - google it first to find the time they come down the road to enter the place. Also the time they bottle feed the babies!!!!
