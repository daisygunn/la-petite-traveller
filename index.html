         <p>The go-to guide for any backpacker!</p>
         <p>I have been very fortunate to spend a lot of time exploring our beautiful planet.
            Whilst there are plenty of travel blogs and guides out there, I found that when researching for
            my first big trip, there just wasn't enough out there about backpacking on a budget that didn't
            involve missing out on half of the country! I want to give you, my readers, the best tips that
            I've learnt along the way so that you can make the most of every second & every penny that
            you have to make life-long memories. <br>
            <br>
            You will also find a review of my most recent trip to Sri Lanka <a href="#my_last_trip" class="cursor">here!</a>

            <h4 class="sub_section_heading">Getting started</h4>
            <p>
               You need to have a good idea of where you want to go even if that's just a starting point before
               contemplating planning (sounds obvious but you'd be surprised how many people just say they want to go
               away!!).<br>
               For my first big backpacking trip, I desperately knew I wanted to start in India and so that was
               destination 1 - it was only once I was in India that I then started to think about where to go next and
               made decisions based on flight prices, weather in the surrounding countries and what the food was meant
               to be
               like! I'm a vegetarian and so food is always a big factor for me. <br>
               This is not the ideal way for many to travel as it does come with some risks but I found not being tied
               down to flights and routes meant I was able to travel based upon the people I was meeting &
               recommendations I was being given.
            </p>

            <h4 class="sub_section_heading">Route planning</h4>
            <p>Read, read & read again, you are not the first person visiting this country and so there will be plenty
               of recommendations available for you. <br>
               If you're stretched for time then be realistic, moving every day is
               bound to knacker you out and won't always allow for the most fun to be had! Of course, we are all
               different people but I find spending 2-3 days in any one place my preferred pace of travel. <br>
               Be flexible, have an idea of where you want to go but be open to it changing. Some of my favourite places
               have been off my planned route - so please do not think you have to stick to any plans!!!
            </p>

            <h4 class="sub_section_heading">Packing</h4>
            <p>Pack light - It is KEY to not overpack, get yourself a decent
               <a href="https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/p/osprey-womens-fairview-70-travel-pack-E2414409.html?channable=00ff736964003230363337305f393876&colour=98&utm_source=google&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping&utm_campaign=Luggage%20Mid%20Priority%20tROAS-BOFU-PLA%20&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_pos=&cq_med=pla&cq_plt=gp&gclid=Cj0KCQjwna2FBhDPARIsACAEc_WcPdMLZhtyg7c35qRCHCMHbA8QVvOnVXGV5kg9ROMx53l6Dzf0YZUaAkFvEALw_wcB')"
                  target="_blank" aria-label="Link to example of a good rucksack, opens in a new tab." class="cursor">bag</a> (look
               into how many litres it is) and be sensible. Do you need 6 pairs of shoes? Probably not.
               You will be so thankful once you're away that your bag doesn't weigh 25kg and that you're able to access
               all of your items with ease. <br>
               It is also very important to consider the countries that you're visiting and ensure that you take
               appropriate clothing so as not to offend. <br>
               Rolling your clothes is the only way to do it, get yourself some <a
                  href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eono-Essentials-Lightweight-Organizers-Accessories/dp/B07JWCW87Y/ref=asc_df_B07JWCW87Y/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310446945021&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12797766163628329236&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006609&hvtargid=pla-596526684374&psc=1"
                  target="_blank" aria-label="Link to packing cubes on Amazon, opens in a new tab" class="cursor">packing cubes</a> and
               organise your stuff into sections, this will make accessing your clothes super quick and easy! <br>
               You can find my downloable essentials packing list <a href="#">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h4 class="sub_section_heading">Budgeting </h4>
            <p>Be strict! Have a good understanding of how much you have to spend per day/per week/per month and only
               allow yourself access to this budget. <br>
               Research how much travelling from place to place is going to cost, consider all options. Travelling
               overnight is often the cheapest way to get around as you also save on a night of accommodation! <br>
               Depending on which country you visit the hostels may have kitchens, this is a great way to save on money
               as you can prepare lunch or dinner. <br>
               Book somewhere that has breakfast included - makes all the difference getting 1 meal a day for free!
               Don't be scared of street food, this is often how the locals eat, the food is cheaper and it's normally
               DELICIOUS.
            </p>

            <h4 class="sub_section_heading">Toiletries</h4>
            <p>Shampoo and conditioner bars are a great way to save on space, weight and money. I bought this <a
                  href="https://uk.lush.com/products/honey-shampoo/honey-i-washed-my-hair" target="_blank"
                  aria-label="Link to Lush shampoo bar, opens in a new page" class="cursor">shampoo</a> and this <a
                  href="https://uk.lush.com/hair-care/conditioner/valkyrie" target="_blank"
                  aria-label="Link to Lush conditioner bar, opens in a new page" class="cursor">conditioner</a> and both lasted me my
               entire 6 months of travelling!! <br>
               Always have Imodium & rehydration sachets (or something similar) just in case you get an upset stomach.
               Having these on hand got me out of a couple of tricky situations. <br>
               I also always take a first aid kit with me, loaded with plasters and painkillers - being prepared for
               anything will make your life so much easier!
            </p>

            <h4 class="sub_section_heading">Useful apps/websites</h4>
            <p>Look into the available travel apps for the country you're visiting, some of my faves are:.
               <ul>
                  <li>Busbud is great for buses in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.
                  </li>
                  <li>HostelBookers <em>(use my code LAPETITET123 for an introductory 15% discount)</em></li>
                  <li>Rome2Rio is great for almost any country you're in, perfect place to start if you're stuck on how
                     to get from A to B.</li>

            <h3 class="sub_heading">My Route</h3>
            <p>I've made it pretty obvious by now that I fell deeply in love with Sri Lanka, the combination of hikes,
               nature, food, culture and of course the beaches was
               something I hadn't expected - it is a real delight and somewhere I would recommend everyone to visit. In
               fact, I don't think I've shut up about it since I
               got home. There is something for everyone and being a pretty small country - the UK is about 3.7 times
               bigger than Sri Lanka - it is quick and easy to get
               around so perfect for shorter trips too!
               Below is a map of my route, I had just over 3 weeks in total and as I was travelling over Christmas I had
               to factor in that everything would be busy and
               fully booked, after some research I decided not to risk being stranded on Christmas Day and I pre-booked
               a few places and so had to stick to my schedule.
               I was also adamant to spend at least 10 days lying on a beach so wanted to move pretty quickly through
               the beginning of my itinerary.

                  The main airport in Sri Lanka is called 'Bandaranaike International Colombo Airport' but is actually
                  located closer to Negombo.
                  My flight got in pretty late so I decided to spend my first night and day in Negombo, it was nice to
                  see the beach but there's not much to see here -
                  can easily be missed.

                  Places to eat:<br>
                  Colombo is Sri Lanka's capital and it is a typically big, busy Asian city but has an interesting
                  architectural twist. Due to the colonial rule in the 16th Century,
                  there are a plethora of beautiful colonial buildings mixed in with swanky new office blocks - making
                  this city a real delight to explore. There is an abundance of
                  street food available in the markets and the Pettah Bazaar is definitely worth a visit.
                  The Barefoot bar is an iconic Colombo institution and offers live Jazz on Sundays - this is not a
                  cheap place and so not ideal for those of us on a tight budget!
                  If I'm being totally honest, we probably should have spent more time properly exploring Colombo but
                  with just under a month (and a desperate want to sit on the beach)
                  I wanted to get moving ASAP and so only spent a night.

                  Places to eat:<br>
                  As luck would have it there was a train strike when we were in Sri Lanka which meant I had to revert
                  to travelling by bus - we got a bus to Dambulla and then a tuktuk to our guest house. We stayed at
                  Landun Sigirya Villas and I cannot recommend it enough - our host was delightful and made some of the
                  nicest food I've ever eaten in my life.
                  Sigirya is famous for 'Lions Rock' which is an impressive sight from below and offers stunning views
                  from the top. It takes just over an hour to climb and is mostly up stairs. Get there early, avoid the
                  crowds and also the height of the sun!
                  I was also advised by a friend to climb the smaller rock opposite Pidarangula, this is less of a
                  tourist attraction and is more of a wild climb - there are no stairs and it involves some basic
                  climbing. The top offers incredible views of Lions Rock and the climb was a little more fun.

               <p>Dambulla - 1 afternoon <br>
                  We stopped in Dambulla on the way to the bus station as we wanted to visit the Dambulla Cave Temple;
                  it is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka.
                  The rock towers 160 m over the surrounding plains. Major attractions are spread over five caves, which
                  contain statues and paintings. It comes with a small cost of 1500 LUK and is well worth it!

               <p>Kandy - 2 nights <br>
                  Stayed: <br>
                  Places to eat:<br>
                  We got the bus to Kandy, the city's heart is scenic Kandy Lake (Bogambara Lake), which is popular for
                  strolling. Kandy is famed for sacred Buddhist sites, including the Temple of the Tooth (Sri Dalada
                  Maligawa) shrine, celebrated with the grand Esala Perahera annual procession.
                  We hired a tuk tuk for the day to take us around, we visited the Pinnawella elephant sanctuary (where
                  you can bottle feed baby elephants!!!!) & the Royal Botanical Gardens which are an absolute delight,
                  think Kew Gardens but more exotic with monkeys roaming around!
                  In the evening we visited a traditional Kandyian dance show - you will see adverts everywhere for this
                  - I don't know if it was just the one we visited but it felt like a massive tourist trap so I can't
                  say I would recommend.

               <p>Ella - 2 night<br>
                  Stayed: <br>
                  Places to eat:<br>
                  Getting to Ella from Kandy is one of the nicest train rides you'll ever experience and something you
                  absolutley will have seen photos of! YOU MUST BOOK!
                  If you pre-plan far enough in advance (and have the budget) book the observation car as this will
                  offer you panoramic views of the scenery. If, like me,
                  you're unable to book a seat (Christmas tourists meant they sold out) you absolutely will want to get
                  to the train station with ample time to ensure you are by
                  the doors when the train arrives - we were lucky, we got a seat by the window otherwise you'll find
                  yourself sat on the floor with no air-con or breeze!
                  Ella is another real treat for the hikers out there; we arrived relatively late on the first night and
                  so we just had dinner in our guesthouse and hit the sack.
                  The following morning we got up at the crack of dawn to climb Ella's rock - be warned the route to the
                  top is not the easiest and there will be locals
                  that want to guide you (for a fee of course) and may even throw you off the right path to do so! This
                  is a great <a href="https://nomadicboys.com/trekking-to-ella-rock/" target="_blank"
                     aria-label="Link to step-by-step guide to climb Ella's rock, opens in a new tab.">step-by-step
                     guide</a> to follow.
                  Also in Ella is Adam's Peak, another beautiful trek that is best made in the early hours so that you
                  get to the top for sunrise - we were very unlucky in that our next morning had rain and so we didn't
                  actually go.
                  We did, however, take a walk to the 9 Arch Bridge which provides another iconic view and a great photo
                  op!

               <p>Udawalwe - 2 nights <br>
                  Stayed: <br>
                  Places to eat:<br>
                  We decided to do a safari at Udawalawe National Park due to the amount of elephants that live there,
                  we got a bus
                  from Ella and booked our safari through the guest house we were staying at. They picked us up at
                  5.30am and took us
                  straight to the National Park. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. We saw an unbelievable amount of animals, elephants
                  - even a baby,
                  crocodiles, bison, peacocks & tropical birds - and the best part is the entrance fee was only £25. A
                  slightly steep
                  activity when living on budget of £30 a day but well worth it. How many times in your life are you
                  going to expeirence that?!

               <p>Tallala<br>
                  Stayed: <br>
                  Places to eat:<br>
                  We could not wait until we got to the coast and we were not disappointed; I can honestly say the
                  beaches rival
                  those of the Philippines and in some cases were even nicer, mainly due to the lack of people on
                  them!!!
                  We opted to travel first to Tallala and base ourselves there so that we could explore some of the
                  surrounding beaches.
                  Hiriketiya is just beautiful and great place to surf! Just down from the beach is where I ate one of
                  the best meals of my
                  life. We then visited Dikwella the next day which was completely empty and stunning.

                  Places to eat:<br>
                  We got to Mirissa on Christmas eve and stayed in a pretty nice air bnb - it was a real Christmas
                  treat.
                  We partied on the beach and spent christmas day super hungover round our pool and so didn't really
                  explore much!
                  We then visited Wijaya beach where you can snorkel and swim with turtles, rental of the snorkel
                  equipment is cheap.
                  The beach bar here is also delightful!

                  We then moved along to Unawatuna, one of the busier coastal towns and for good reason, there is so
                  much to do and see!
                  It was NYE over our time here and so again didn't do too much exploring, just visited beaches in the
                  day and partied at night!
                  Jungle Beach was really cool and very chill, a great place to snorkel!
