## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

La Petite Traveller's target users are:
* Aged 18-30
* Past/future backpackers
* People interested in travelling on a budget
* Have an interest in visiting Sri Lanka

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Beautiful photos that provide inspiration and make the destinations look desirable
* Helpful guidance on routes available
* Recommendations for where to eat/stay

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information as this is often the reason people are put off with travel guides.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Carousel with images of holiday destinations to immediately entice the user
- Information section full of tips for backpacking
- Downloadble Checklist of things to pack
- Overview ratings for a recent trip, Sri Lanka
- Map of the route taken
- Information, recommendations and advice for travelling Sri Lanka
- Gallery of images of Sri Lanka trip
- Newsletter sign up form
- Links to affiliate social media pages & email address

### *Structure* 

This website is a single page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever section of the site they are interested in or they can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed. I chose the following order for the information 'Home > Travel Tips 101 > My Last Trip > Keep in Touch', as I felt this would allow for the information to be digested in the best way. The text blocks are broken up with images to ensure interest is kept and there is no information overload at any point. There is a concise review of Sri Lanka before the more in-detail guide as I wanted users to be able to find these key bits of information quickly. Finally there is a simple sign up form for users to sign up to the La Petite Traveller's newsletter.

### **Surface**
I chose a colour palette based around a blues and greens as these colours remind me of the sea & being amongst nature; I want the users of this website to be transported to their own memories of travelling and believe these colours will help to do this. I paired these with two lighter shades in order to allow for appropriate contrast. 

## **Features**
This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; the page divided the page into the four sections listed in the navbar. Where a colour background has been used it has a slightly transparent opacity and the text is an off-white. All of the headings use the font Cookie and the body text is Raleway. 

*Navbar*
The navbar is placed on top of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen. The image I have chosen is representative of the sites theme and incorporates the colour pallete, it immediately encourages the user to be on holiday and entices them to read further. 

*About section*
This is where I introduce myself and the page and give a brief insight into why it was created, I have used a H2 element for the main heading, followed by a H3 tag line and then a more descriptive paragraph. I wanted to keep this section simple and clean as there is plenty more information to follow.  

*Travel Tips 101*
This section starts with a H2 heading and is the followed by a series of H4 and P elements, this structure is used to provide clarity of the items within this section. 

*My Last Trip section*
This section includes the most information on the page and so I wanted to include imagery alongside text. The title is a H2 element that is set on a responsive hero image, this is followed by a concise review of Sri Lanka. The review is built using an ul element & icons from FontAwesome. 
There is then a seperate div that contains a far more detailed review of Sri Lanka, this features a map embedded using GoogleMaps and also a read more/read less button. I want users to read this information only if they want to and it not be an overwhelming amount of text on their screen. 
I have then included an interactive photo gallery of images of my trip to Sri Lanka, this uses HTML, CSS and some JavaScript.

*Keep in touch*
